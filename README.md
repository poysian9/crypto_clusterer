# Conclusions
*   After cleaning the data I was left with 109 tradable cryptocurrencies 
*   The dimensions of this df were then reduced from 70 features to 3 priciple components and clustered into 4 categories accoring to the Elbow Curve
*   From the last table we can see that we have mined very little compared to our max supply, most of which can be explained by cryptocurrencies with infinite money supply
